Read me files have been a real learning exp.this README is just a notes. What i learned is amazing. For one thing is you have more than 1 repository make sure they do not share the same main folder/ the files will bleed over for example if you have a Readme file in two this can allow the other readme to place notaion in you file with no help from you.
If ther are two todolist

node_modules,  now they really like to share. Once they share you could loose a lot of information becase they become intertwined. I had ToDOMatic and a folder INTET2000-Project2 both in same folder and at Git. When i tried to delete Project2 Git would not let me. GOOD Thing. On my own explorer i moved the file out of main folder/omg next all hell broke loose. NO features errors all over the place. so I tightend up my Todo.jsx brought back the folder i had removed ther were all my fetures and cteated a 2nd Todolist.jsx which included some code needed to make things correct.

The good part is that now i only had 1 .css file in my folder. this was major. 
using the  main jsx will always remind you of what is in front of your nose.
I did not understand filters until this project const FILTER_NAMES = Object.keys(FILTER_MAP);  While nothing else worked, i decide to try to use some of the features that were not being used. with const filterList = FILTER_NAMES.map((name, index) => {  // now i could do somthing with those sleeping buttons.

I need to get proficient at cleaner code. I tend to make redundant codeing becaseu im not always sure what is being read. but the console.log will tell no lies
 hopefully this README  will behave so I can keep my notes// the real launching for git is 5276 but my regular is 5500// i learned this updatein vite over 100 times

 now i want all the info to be pushed to branch-two-todo, since they are merged will this happen automatically
